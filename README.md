## 🚀 HACK RIMI  
- This is my second project, so there might still be some mistakes.  

## 🔗 Install C++: https://www.msys2.org/  
- To run my code, you need to install C++ first.
- Then put `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin` on the PATH

## 🔍 ADJUSTMENTS REQUIRED  
- You need to modify a few things to search for character names.  
- Specifically, update the file path to **rimi.csv**.  
- If you're unsure how to do this, feel free to contact me! :3  

## 🛠️ HOW TO RUN THE CODE?  
- This code runs on platforms like DevC++, Code::Blocks, CP Editor, VS Code, etc.
  (It won't work on web-based compilers.)  
- Copy the **hint** of the character and paste it into the code's input.  
- The code will quickly find the character's name and automatically add **".claim"** for you.  
- Your only task is to paste it into Discord and claim the cards!  

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES  
- Don't claim too fast (wait about **1-2 seconds** after the card appears).  
- Don't claim too frequently (avoid hopping between servers just to grab cards).  

## 🤖 ABOUT THE BOT  
- This bot is still small, so it's updated frequently.  
- The command to view all character names is blocked, so I only have a few available.  
- If you notice any missing characters, please let me know via Discord!
